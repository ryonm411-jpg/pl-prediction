# football-model

This workspace stores tactical match notes in Markdown and includes templates and scaffolding
for converting those notes into ratings and predictions later.

Structure:
- `match_analysis/` — place one Markdown file per match (user will create these).
- `teams/` — per-team profile files (long-term tendencies).
- `src/` — Python code (parsing, ratings, update scripts). Placeholders only.
- `data/` — machine-readable state (ratings.json, configs). Do not populate.
- `templates/` — Markdown templates (match template, team template).

This repository is scaffolding only. No analysis or data population is included.
